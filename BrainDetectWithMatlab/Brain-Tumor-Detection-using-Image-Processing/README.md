# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Image-Processing
Brain Tumour Extraction from MRI Images Using MATLAB






Introduction

The field of medicine is always a necessity and development in them is basic necessity for betterment of human kind
Medical image processing is the most challenging and emerging field now a days. Processing of MRI images is one
Of the part of this field. Identification Tumour are rising problem as there is rise in people being affected by tumour this rise is caused by lot of factors from habits to pollution . Locating a tumour as always been problem as that requires a lot of experience of human anatomy which is requires a lot of time. 
This project describes the proposed strategy to detect & extraction of brain tumour from patients. 

MRI scan images of the brain. This method incorporates with, segmentation and morphological operations which are the basic concepts of image processing. Detection and extraction of tumour from MRI scan images of the brain is done by using MATLAB software. We first want concentrate creating a program which requires a small processing time for result .

Executing the code

1.	Open the Code in matlab
2.	Change the directory for each input image

   Example for image 5
   I=imread('C:\Users\Naren Adithya\Desktop\5.jpg');

3.	Run the code
