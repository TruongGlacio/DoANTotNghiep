# Sleep detection

This repository contains two app for driver drowsiness detection via eye monitoring being it closed or opened.

1. Python code: Simple app to detect the status of eye being it closed or opened (sleep_detection.py (test1.jpg and test2.jpg are for testing))


2. C++ code: Realtime sleep detection (cpp code/sleep_detection.cpp)
